- **Khalti Payment Gateway** (for secure payments)
- **Open Street Maps and Geolocation** (for location and mapping features)

These features provide a comprehensive and user-friendly travel management experience for both customers and admins.

## Getting Started

1. **Flutter SDK**
 Ensure you have Flutter SDK version `>=3.0.5` installed. [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if not already set up.
2. **FlutterFire CLI**
 Install the FlutterFire CLI, which simplifies Firebase configuration for Flutter projects:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```
3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sushil787/Single-Vendor-Travel.git
    cd travel_management_system/apps
    ```
    Since the project includes both a client app and an admin web app, you need to configure Firebase for both parts of the application.
    ```bash
    cd t_admin or cd t_client
    ```
  
4. **Install Dependencies**
 Install all project dependencies using the following command:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
      ```
5. **Configure Firebase with FlutterFire CLI**
    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```
    The FlutterFire CLI will generate a firebase_options.dart file with your Firebase configuration. Make sure this file is imported in your main.dart file for Firebase initialization.
6. **Generate Code with build_runner**
    The project uses generated models, Bloc state and event classes for state management. Run the following command to generate necessary files:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
    This will generate:
    - Models for data management and serialization.
    - State Classes and Bloc Files for managing app state and events. 
    Note: Run this command every time you make changes to models, state, or event classes.

7. **Run the App**
    After configuring Firebase and generating the necessary files, you can now run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Important Packages

### State Management
- **flutter_bloc**: Used for managing the app's state across different components, ensuring clear state transitions and predictable behaviors.
- **get_it**: Acts as a service locator for dependency injection, helping to manage and retrieve services and data classes from anywhere in the app.

### Payment Integration
- **khalti_flutter**: Used for secure payment processing, allowing users to complete transactions directly in the app. Khalti integration ensures a smooth and secure transaction process, providing a trusted payment gateway for users to make online payments for bookings and other services.


### Firebase Integration
- **firebase_auth**: Manages user authentication, enabling sign-in and sign-out flows using Firebase's secure authentication methods.
- **cloud_firestore**: Used for real-time data storage and syncing, allowing users to access data such as bookings, itineraries, and user profiles.
- **firebase_storage**: Stores user-uploaded files, such as profile images or travel documents, securely on Firebase’s cloud storage.
- **firebase_messaging**: Enables push notifications, allowing real-time updates to be sent to users for bookings, offers, and other relevant alerts.

### Location & Mapping
- **geolocator**: Provides real-time location tracking for users, assisting in calculating travel distances or nearby landmarks.
- **latlong2**: Handles geographic location data, crucial for mapping functionalities and integrating with various geolocation-based services.
- **flutter_osm_plugin** and **flutter_map**: Used for integrating interactive maps within the app, allowing users to view locations and itineraries visually on a map.

### Data Persistence & Caching
- **hive** and **hive_flutter**: Provides lightweight, offline storage capabilities, which are ideal for storing small data sets like user preferences and session information.

### User Interface & Experience
- **google_fonts**: Allows for customizable fonts, enhancing the app’s design and readability.
- **shimmer**: Provides a shimmer loading effect, creating an engaging placeholder while data is being loaded.
