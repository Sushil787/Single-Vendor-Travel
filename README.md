# Travello - Travel Management System

**Travello**  is a travel management system built with Flutter, featuring both a mobile app for clients and a web app for admin management. Firebase serves as the backend, providing real-time updates, authentication, and secure data storage.

- **t_client**: A mobile app for clients to manage their travel bookings, view itineraries, and receive real-time updates. The app is built with Flutter and uses Firebase as the backend for authentication, data storage, and notifications.
- **t_admin**: A web app for admins to manage bookings, oversee client information, and handle app content efficiently. This application is also built with Flutter, providing a cohesive administrative interface for the Travello system.

## Project Structure

- **t_client**: Contains all the code and resources for the client-side mobile application, including:
  - **User Authentication**: Secure user login and sign-up using Firebase Authentication.
  - **Booking Management**: Tools for clients to view, modify, and cancel bookings.
  - **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for booking confirmations, reminders, and travel updates.
  - **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing through Khalti for seamless in-app transactions.

- **t_admin**: Contains the code and resources for the admin-side web application, featuring:
  - **User and Booking Management**: Allows admins to manage client accounts, bookings, and service offerings.
  - **Content Management**: Tools to manage and update travel packages, destinations, and other app content.
  - **Reporting and Analytics**: Insights on bookings and user activity to aid in business decision-making.

Refer to each folder (`apps/t_client` and `apps/t_admin`) for further documentation and setup instructions tailored to each app.

***ðŸ’» Built with***
Tools, BASS and Framework used in the project:
*   Flutter
*   Firebase
*   Visual Studio Code
*   Flutter Fire Cli
*   Android Studio



## Getting Started

1. **Flutter SDK**
 Ensure you have Flutter SDK version `>=3.0.5` installed. [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if not already set up.
2. **FlutterFire CLI**
 Install the FlutterFire CLI, which simplifies Firebase configuration for Flutter projects:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```
3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sushil787/Single-Vendor-Travel.git
    cd travel_management_system/apps
    ```
    Since the project includes both a client app and an admin web app, you need to configure Firebase for both parts of the application.
    ```bash
    cd t_admin or cd t_client
    ```
  
4. **Install Dependencies**
 Install all project dependencies using the following command:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
      ```
5. **Configure Firebase with FlutterFire CLI**
    ```bash
    flutterfire configure
    ```
    The FlutterFire CLI will generate a firebase_options.dart file with your Firebase configuration. Make sure this file is imported in your main.dart file for Firebase initialization.
6. **Generate Code with build_runner**
    The project uses generated models, Bloc state and event classes for state management. Run the following command to generate necessary files:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
    This will generate:
    - Models for data management and serialization.
    - State Classes and Bloc Files for managing app state and events. 
    Note: Run this command every time you make changes to models, state, or event classes.

7. **Run the App**
    After configuring Firebase and generating the necessary files, you can now run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
